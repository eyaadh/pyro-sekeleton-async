# Kittenz – Pyro-Skeleton-Async:
This project was built to demonstrate how we at [@baivaru](https://t.me/Baivaru) structures - 
their async [pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) projects. I could have written a skeleton (directory structures, modules 
showing where plugins are loaded from and etc) which you could simply clone and build upon it. 
However, doing that could have left you halfway through the whole purpose of “making it easier” 
and having a skeleton. Therefore, the following project is a fully functional bot that would demonstrate 
most of the common methods, functionalities [pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) offers you to start programing a simple telegram bot 
and some clean practices that we at [@baivaru](https://t.me/Baivaru) follow which you could refer and imply with your projects.

## Cloning & Run:
1. `git clone https://github.com/eyaadh/pyro-sekeleton-async.git`, to clone the repository.
2. `cd pyro-sekeleton-async`, to enter the directory.
3. `pip3 install -r requirments.txt`, to install the dependencies/requirements.
4. Create a new `config.ini` using the sample available at `pyro-sekeleton-async\working_dir`. Also details on the variables available bellow.
5. Run with `python3.8 -m pyro`, stop with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
> It is recommended to use [virtual environments](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) while running the app, this is a good practice you can use at any of your python projects as virtualenv creates an isolated Python environment which is specific to your project.
